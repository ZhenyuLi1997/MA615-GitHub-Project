## About

The dataset uses for this report is "attenu", which contains the measurements of the peak acceleration of 24 earthquakes in California at different observation stations.

Source: Joyner, W.B., D.M. Boore and R.D. Porcella (1981). Peak horizontal acceleration and velocity from strong-motion records including records from the 1979 Imperial Valley, California earthquake. USGS Open File report 81-365. Menlo Park, Ca.

## Visualization

```{r}
plot(attenu$dist, attenu$accel, 
     xlab="station-hypocenter distance (km)", 
     ylab="peak acceleration (g)")
title(main="Acceleration vs Distance")
```

The graph shows: peak accelerations (g) vs station-hypocenter distance (km)
