## About

The dataset contains the measurement of the peak accelerations of 24 earthquakes in California at various different observation stations.

## Visualization 

The graph shows: peak accelerations (g) vs station-hypocenter distance(km)

```{r}
plot(attenu$dist, attenu$accel, xlab="station-hypocenter distance (km)", ylab="peak acceleration (g)")
title(main="Accel vs Dist")
```
